    " - My aim is to learn techniques and then how to extend them.\n",
    " - Many thanks to the fork's original owner Dr. Alvinleenh.\n",
    " - I have also learned from Chris Deotte's model and notebook 60k-data-with-context-v2 on which ITK8191 (using DeepSpeed) and ZMSHUM also built and was then studied by me (incorporated into this notebook.)\n",
    " - The code also builds on MB's work in Notebook [86.2] with only 270K articles!\n",
    " - nagupv/longformer-large-4096-answering-race_LLMMDLPREFOLD_60k_24_09_2023_3 from Hugging Face is also included which provides the 7th and in isolation most accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical notes as experiments were run:\n",
    "1. Adding \"clever\" context seems to harm the score.\n",
    "2. The embeddings need to remain Flat (pretty much original brute force)\n",
    "3. The predictions in the ensemble have differing means and variances or ranges\n",
    "4. The model making predictions4 is the worst performing, trying to exclude it (score dropped to .743). Bottom line, this worst of the pack still helps the pack.\n",
    "5. Adding a statistical weighting to model predictions scored .755\n",
    "6. Using a majority 3 or 4 of 4 voter, else use ensemble average, scored .759\n",
    "7. Adding a context change brought the score to .788\n",
    "8. First replacing model2 with llm-science-run-context-2, score is .819\n",
    "9. Using matching tokenizers except where rejected and more ensemble tweeks\n",
    "10. Moved to three model (*context-2 repeated doubling its weight) .825\n",
    "11. Replaced one *context-2 with another model and maj voter on lowered .819\n",
    "12. Running with batch size of 8 (was 32) and max_lenth 512 (was 386) .816\n",
    "13. Back to batch size 32 and for safety also max length 386\n",
    "14. Running with weights adjusted and majority vote only on full majority 0.826\n",
    "15. Minor tweeks, BATCH_SIZE 16 and NUM_SENTENCES 10 (maybe 22 is too many)?\n",
    "16. Run scaling1 = 0.3 scaling2 = 0.1 scaling3 = 0.1 scaling4 = 0.5 scored .821\n",
    "17. scaling1 = 0.5 caling2 = 0.3 caling3 = 0.3 caling4 = 0.1 scored .827\n",
    "17. .1 Scaled above similar to scale in .01 drops in training model\n",
    "18. Confirm if tokenizer is better from each model or from best model scored \n",
    "18. Add a model, assess training MAP@3 and update scales to see if score change\n",
    "18. 1 Adding the model harmed results - voter 4/5 majority scored .826\n",
    "18. 2 A 3/4/5 majority voter scored .814\n",
    "18. 3 Just a 5 out of 5 majority vote on new ensemble based on stddev and mean scored .831\n",
    "18. 4 Trying just the top three models, same technique, reduced to .828\n",
    "19. New tuning algorithm for the ensemble on training data is producing suboptimal results, and full majority voting 3,4,5 is yielding .817\n",
    "\n",
    "-- shift every model's predictions to 0 via subtracting its mean\n",
    "-- magnify each model's output by the number of times its stddev is smaller than the largest standard deviation (the standard deviation is at scale - magnification 1\n",
    "-- multiple the model predictions by the traing test run on accuracy\n",
    "-- Further add a scaling weight based on the differences of the accuracies as the scaling factor (someone manual final consideration).\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Apply the ensemble scaling by testing the public score of each model separately and then applying this to the factors above.\n",
    "21. Trying two new models (new model 4 and 5) both of which individually score much higher on the Public test set than those they are replacing. However, training scores and Cohen's Kappa therein dropped and this had me concerned. Fortunately, it appears the public data set score is 0.846 suggesting it truly helps the MAP@3 scoring results (the Cohen's Kappa looks only at the first answer being correct and it is really about disagrement negative and agreement positive). \n",
    "22. Put \"/kaggle/input/how-to-train-open-book-model-part-1/model_v2\" back into the ensemble, but don't let it participate in a vote (just have it in the ensemble). This produced a .846 also and likely just a little higher as the version too the new high score.\n",
    "23. Attempting to weight the top to as 3x, middle 3 as 2x, and bottom scoring as 1x produced a score of .841. Back to scaling all 2x and trying 4 and 5 of 5 majority voting also produced .841.\n",
    "24. The first attempt to use DeepSpeed v2 with the -base mode and batch size 4 (instead of 2) as model 6 reducedthe score to .841 (all else was producing .846)\n",
    "25. The second attempt parameterized DeepSpeed as it came, but provided a context2.cvs containing only sources 6 through 12 (7 in all) with bad data removed. Its training score is 0.843 and its public score is 0.767 with an ensemble contribution of 0.838.\n",
    "26. One test run to see what over-writes by a majority voter does to the public score of 0.836. This means a better model will need to be built and added to the ensemble.\n",
    "27. Oddly, running with the Gibberish trained model 6 (DeepSpeed v2), but itself underwhelm with a score of 0.36, the full participation in the ensemble let the ensemble still score a 0.845 almost as if it wasn't even there. Still, it is not helping so I'll see if I can find another approach to add.\n",
    "28. I tried MB's notebook \"[86.2] with only 270k articles!\" and incorporated its use of a LongFormer to build the predictions of model6. My main concern is that the RAM may not be enough for the Public or Private dataset sizes as it has to keep the Deberta predictions in memory until it has the LongFormer model's work also completed. It's going to be tight on RAM and approximately double the GPU use per experiment. However, the training data self-check is encouraging. The final score ranked Silver at 0.887. \n",
    "29. Going to see if a unanimous majority vote helps tip in either direction (a simple majority obviously reinstates the status of the Deberta based models and with 5 of them they win resulting in their lower score). Meanwhile, I'm think about how the longformer can be used to build a second model maybe with Chris' context2. It did not help, the public score stands at 0.887 (no change).\n",
    "30. As I think through options to add a second LongFormer model to the ensemble I will also try just giving the current LongFormer the weight of 2 models to see what impact that has on the public score (it turns out to be 0.885 so not a good idea).\n",
    "31. The first alternative LongFormer was from the Kaggle dataset \"longformer\" which loads with warnings about uninitialized weights and on its own scored 0.816 on the public set, however, when run with the ensemble it brought down the score to 0.82 and so I'm not going to proceed with it.\n",
    "31. I'm adding another LongFormer (nagupv/longformer-large-4096-answering-race_LLMMDLPREFOLD_60k_24_09_2023_3 from Hugging Face) - it does not affect the training internal score in any significant way, but then that score is pretty close to maxed out so we need to see the Public score which turns out being 0.885). Also, a parallel test confirms the new LongFormer (which combined Chris' data with the race dataset on training) achieves 0.882 on its own).\n",
    "32. The LongFormer models use softmax which limits the predictions to output no greater than 1 on each answer, and no more than a sum of 1 for each questions answers. This makes comparison to the Deberta models unpredictable which is now resolved by having the Deberta models predictions also put through the softmax algorithm (this preserves the answers the individual models will produce, and scales them to be arithmatically in the same range as each other and the LongFormer model predictions.\n",
    "33. Weight the two LongFormers heaviest, then the three middle models per known Public score accuracy to be just a little less than the LongFormers together (to break ties among the LongFormers or upset them as long as all three of the top Deberta models agree), and weight the bottom two Deberta models just enough to match a single of the top three Deberta models so long as they both agree. This scored a Public ensemble 0.897\n",
    "34. Ensemble effectiveness and weights (scaling) study. Experiment 12 will try swapping out \"llm-se-debertav3-large\" for \"how-to-train-open-book-model-part-1/model_v2\" in Model 3. Experiment 13 will swap out \"deberta-v3-large-freeze16-512/deberta_v3_large_freeze16_512\" for \"how-to-train-open-book-model-part1/model_v2\". The model being swapped out individually underperforms, however, how it is built is different than the other deberta models and longformer so the experiment is to see if helps where those models fail in breaking ties.\n",
